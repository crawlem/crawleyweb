After owning a Macbook for 18 months as a home machine, I recently made the switch to Mac for my main work laptop too. Since I got my Macbook Pro 15" I've had a lot of colleagues and customers ask me why I switched, particularly people who have never used a Mac but know how much they cost.

The reason is pretty simple: they're excellent. Hardware is excellent. MacOS is excellent. Support is excellent (I have a local Apple Store).

Since leaving Windows behind I've had exactly zero crashes. My Mac boots up in seconds and is intelligent enough to know when to standby and when to hibernate (based on battery remaining), saving me precious time. I've not needed Anti-Virus or Anti-Spyware software.

They're genius. I couldn't go back.
