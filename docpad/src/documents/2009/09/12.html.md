I've just finished reading [All the President's Men](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0747578591?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=crawleys-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0747578591), the book written by the journalists who exposed the Watergate scandal. It was absolutely fascinating, and I spent several hours on Wikipedia during and after I read it, learning more about what happened. IÂ  also watched the film that was on recently.

All things US Presidential have been intriguing me since I went to the states in October and got caught up in the buzz of the election. I couldn't believe the hype involved in the presidential campaigns, and the tendency to simplify policies into a soundbyte, without giving any detail whatsoever.

Actually my interest was piqued before that, when I started watching [The West Wing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002HRE4DI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=crawleys-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B002HRE4DI), which is one of my favourite TV shows ever. Jo and I have recently finished watching the entire series again, and I loved it just as much. I really hope that presidential politics actually are as intelligent and thoughtful... in Nixon's day you have to assume they weren't.
