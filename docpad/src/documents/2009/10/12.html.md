I went on a business trip to Atlanta a couple of weeks ago, and had a fantasic time. The deep south is a facinating place, full of friendly and hospitable folk - that was my experience anyway. 

The food was outstanding both in its quality and its ubiquitous availability! I ate some of the best BBQ known to man, dined at a Brazillian buffet (sounds random but was awesome) and sampled some of the local brews. 

A real eye opener trip, I'd definitely return be it for business or pleasure. Or both!
