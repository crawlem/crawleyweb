Well for the first time in my life I'm in Australia! 

I don't want to dwell on how hateful the flights to get here were, so nuff said.

In any case, the most dangerous part of the journey was the taxi from my house to Heathrow, which only lasted 90 minutes but during which the taxi driver nearly crashed 3 times. 

My flight went via Hong Kong for refuelling, so I now have an intimate knowledge of the airport. The staff were very friendly and deferential, and I'm pretty sure I heard French-style accordion music playing in the terminal, but I was a zombie by that stage!

Melbourne is awesome and I'm staying right in the centre close to the tennis. You can't move for restaurants, coffee shops and bars so it's my kind of town. So far I don't think the temperature has dropped below 17 degrees which is a nice change from January in England!

I had a stonking Chinese last night and Dave introduced me to the best smoothies bar ever. I am being healthy... Honest!
