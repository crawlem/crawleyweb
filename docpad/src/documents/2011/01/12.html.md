Well qualifying started yesterday despite some rain, and we finished play just after 11pm. It really started chucking it so we took tournament transport back to the hotel.

Today was the first day of venue dinner, roast beef with roasted veg and mash. Having got used to the culinary delights of Wimbledon (which haven't improved over 10 years) I was very pleasantly surprised. Bonza.

We're a bit thin on the ground this morning...
