Only three days left :( Today is road trip day! We left around lunch time heading for Glendale New Hampshire, by Lake Adirondak. The drive was beautiful, through fall colours and every now and then off the Interstate to avoid tolls. 

We drove past a massive outlet shopping centre in NH and stopped to go into Old Navy and some other stores. I finally bought some clothes! We kept going up to the lakes which were truly gorgeous. There were lots of hotels/motels on highways, and some off the Interstate (signposted), and seemed like a popular holiday destination for Americans. 

We tried to go to Portsmouth NH but TomTom took us to the middle of nowhere! So we headed home. I nearly had a crash when I missed a red light while looking at a McDonalds! Fortunately I stopped in time. We also saw a guy speed past us on the inside get stopped by the cops, who had been sat at the side of the Interstate with their lights off! 

We stopped at Walmart for some food for tea - it was MASSIVE! We got back around 2030 and stayed up really late watching Law and Order and doing puzzles.
