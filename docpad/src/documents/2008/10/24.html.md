Ideally we'd have gone whale watching today, but we were low on cash and short on time! We walked down to Long Wharf where the tours left from, and decided to visit the [New England Aquarium](http://www.neaq.org/index.php) and the iMax cinema instead. The aquarium was cool, and they had a massive penguin collection. We killed a couple of hours before we saw The Dark Knight at 1600. It was awesome! 

We walked back to the hotel to pack up a bit, then I went out for gas. When I got back we went over to Maggiano's for dinner. There was a 45 minute wait (we arrived just before 1900) so we had cocktails at the bar before we shared a massive bowl of pasta ("Rigatoni D")!
