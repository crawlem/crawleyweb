Sad to see Wags looking quite nervous at the cattery, hope he's OK! We had a nice Beefeater in Basingstoke on the way up, Jo had ribs and I had a burger.

Parking at Bedfont was easy, G4S signed us in and called us a cab. Â£15 to the [Park Inn Hotel](http://www.parkinn.co.uk/airporthotel-heathrow), so not bad. We arrived just after 2100 and checked in.

Early start tomorrow (0500), hope we can sleep with the noise from Heathrow! Waiting for two extra pillows... hope they arrive soon!
