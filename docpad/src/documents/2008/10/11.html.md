Very early start today, alarm set for 0445 as we had to catch the Hotel Hoppa at 0530. We actually made it for the 0515 coach, and got to Terminal 3 before we should have even left the hotel!

We checked in without incident and wandered around for a bit before getting breakfast at O'Neils. Today was all about traveling - over 12 hours of flying ahead with American Airlines.

Heathrow to Chicago was on a 777 and we had our own pair of seats near the back. 3 movies, 2 lots of food and 8 hours later we landed in Chicago, feeling pretty rinsed already! -6 hours will do that! We had to pick up our baggage and drop it off for our onward connection to Vegas. We had a couple of hours to kill so mooched and got a McDs!

Chicago - Las Vegas was AA Boeing 757, so we had more cramped conditions and someone else sat with us (a friendly American dude). 4 hours, no personal TVs and another -2hours. We were very ready to get off the plane, and really wanted a nap as it was 0200 UK time, but only 1500 local!

Taxi to [Bellagio](http://www.bellagio.com/) stiffed us for $28, but wow! Our hotel is absolutely gorgeous, massive and expensive. [Our room (24608)](http://www.bellagio.com/hotel/fountain-view.aspx) is lovely too. By the time we'd bathed/showered there wasn't time for a nap before we picked up the tickets for ["O"](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/o/default.aspx) and got a bite to eat - probably a good thing! We walked through the casino to the "O" ticket desk - it is awesome! Our tickets were ready for us, then we want to Caf√© P--- for a sandwich, a cookie and plenty of water to rehydrate after the flying. $25 for that!

"O" was absolutely incredible. We were in seats B8 and B9, right at the front. We got splashed a couple of times, nothing serious. Best seats I think, right up close to the performers. Acrobatics were amazing, especially high diving. When it ended by eyes were starting to droop so off to bed straight away! I just hope we sleep OK and jet lag doesn't kick in too badly.
