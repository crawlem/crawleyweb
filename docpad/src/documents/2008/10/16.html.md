We lazed in bed until lunchtime and watched Cool Runnings and some gash. We decided to go down to the Financial District today, and we left around lunch time. We went on the subway down to the World Trade Center. There wasn't much to see, but they're building something new on the old site. We strolled around Battery Park and sat for a while overlooking the Statue of Liberty. There were some great views of the skyscrapers and New Jersey.

We decided to get the free Staten Island Ferry which sails past the Statue of Liberty for a closer look. By this time it was 1730 so the ferry out to Staten Island was packed. We didn't take any photos on the way out, and at the other end we walked straight round to get back on the ferry to Manhattan - this time it was empty! We got some photos but suspect they won't be that good as the light was fading and boat moving!

We got the subway back to Times Square and wandered back towards the hotel on 41st. We didn't want fries, grease or burgers so went into Bar 41 for a few drinks and a light dinner. It was nice to drink Bud/wine 'til late.
