We got up quite late and headed over to the Copley Square area for some shopping. The passed the largest Apple Store in the USA on Boylston and made a note to come back later for Rich's iPod Touch. We went into the Prudential Centre mall which was huge, and bought a few things. We went for lunch at the Cheesecake Factory and had pasta and cheesecake. We couldn't finish! - and got a doggy bag. We found a tea shop and got some stuff for Larry and Sue, then headed back to Apple. The store was great and we got an IBM discount on the iTouch and case.

When we got back to the Radisson I went to take a photo or two upstairs looking over the Charles River, and to pick up a Boston Globe. We were still full from lunch, and Jo wasn't feeling too well! We went for ad rive down to Castle Island, then up to Harvard.

When we got home we fancied a midnight (2200) feast so I drove over to Beacon Hill to pick up beer, hot chocolate, crisps and beef jerky. I managed to find a parking space and went to a 7-11 for the supplies. When it came to the hot chocolate I had to choose what cup to use: Obama, McCain or plan - this was used as polling data for the Presidential election!

The feast was wikid! We stayed up watching [Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (SVU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit) which we'd just discovered.
