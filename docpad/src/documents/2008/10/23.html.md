We stayed in bed late (1500!) and ate bagels we'd bought at Walmart. We decided to go to the cinema to see Body of Lies (DiCaprio/Crowe) so I looked up cinema information on the hotel Internet PCs, and we decided to spend the rest of the day in Cambridge, have a look around Harvard then see the movie.

Parking proved a problem in Cambridge - $23 for the day! It was nice to wander around Cambridge though, Harvard is beautiful. We spent the afternoon around Harvard Square, and ate an early dinner at Wagamamas. We strolled back through the Harvard buildings and got a coffee/hot chocolate before the movie at 1850. We went to the Church St theatre, which was a bit old school/run down. Picture quality/sound wasn't great! The film was good though, very well acted and directed. Jo had popcorn :)

We drove back to the hotel after trying unsuccessfully to find a gas station!
