I woke up early again (0630) and watched the sun rise from our bedroom window - beautiful. We decided to do the buffet for breakfast, then explore the Strip southwards. Brekkie was $30 all you can eat, and we did! Then we rolled out, headed down Bellagio Drive to the Miracle Mile shops in Planet Hollywood.

Shops weren't too bad, and I saw a nice Fossil watch for $125... didn't buy it! There was a [fake rainstorm](http://www.miraclemileshopslv.com/entertain.php?id=19) which was cool. And we picked up some souvenirs like Casino playing cards, fridge magnets and  ---.

Then we went out through Planet Hollywood, walking down the strip, passing some shops. Jo wanted to go into M&M World, and we saw a 3D movie and bought some M&Ms for the plane tomorrow. Then the casino tour began:

- MGM Grand: nice casino, had a Starbucks and chatted to a couple from Bristol
- Excalibur: cool inside, nice fairy tale theme. Could be good for April.
- Luxor: not impressed, casino area not particularly themed. Connected to Excalibur via internal walkway.
- New York, New York: very cool!

We were bushed after that, retired to our room then to the pool again. We booked a table at [Todd English's Olives](http://www.bellagio.com/restaurants/olives.aspx) for 2030.

Olives was good - a bit weird but nice. V expensive - bottle of wine was around $100. We had this nice sweet potato flatbread, covered in ham, spring onions, gorgonzola and balsamic vinegar. Waiter a bit brash, --- it because we had to, but great view of the fountains.

We hit the casino on the 1c slots, each with $1. I doubled my money! Then played a few hands of blackjack to get some chips to bring back. I played $10 a hand and started with $50 - I came out with $80! Score!

Packed and hit the hay around 2300, early start tomorrow to fly to NYC.
