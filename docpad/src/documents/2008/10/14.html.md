I woke up before 0400 and couldn't sleep so had a long shower before waking Jo. Taxi to the airport was $16 this time! Check in was a nightmare, but now about to board our flight which is delayed by 30 minutes.

The flight was fine, got in just after 1600. We got a $15 bus ride into Manhattan which took a while - about an hour. We got dropped off near [the hotel](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/hilton-times-square-NYCTSHF/index.html) and checked in no problem. Room 3115 looks down onto 42nd, it's not as plush as the Bellagio!

We took a stroll around Times Square and found a BBQ restaurant called [Virgil's](http://www.virgilsbbq.com/newyork/), which was really cool. We ate ribs smoked in Hickory which were delicious but very filling! We went for a coffee at Starbucks across the road from the hotel then crashed.
