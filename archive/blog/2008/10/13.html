We decided to do the buffet for breakfast, then explore the Strip southwards. Brekkie was $30 all you can eat, and we did! Then we rolled out, headed down Bellagio Drive to the Miracle Mile shops in Planet Hollywood.</p> <p>Shops weren&#39;t too bad, and I saw a nice Fossil watch for $125... didn&#39;t buy it! There was a <a href="http://www.miraclemileshopslv.com/entertain.php?id=19">fake rainstorm</a> which was cool. And we picked up some souvenirs like Casino playing cards, fridge magnets and ---.</p> <p>Then we went out through Planet Hollywood, walking down the strip, passing some shops. Jo wanted to go into M&amp;M World, and we saw a 3D movie and bought some M&amp;Ms for the plane tomorrow. Then the casino tour began:</p> <ul> <li>MGM Grand: nice casino, had a Starbucks and chatted to a couple from Bristol</li> <li>Excalibur: cool inside, nice fairy tale theme. Could be good for April.</li> <li>Luxor: not impressed, casino area not particularly themed. Connected to Excalibur via internal walkway.</li> <li>New York, New York: very cool!</li> </ul> <p>We were bushed after that, retired to our room then to the pool again. We booked a table at <a href="http://www.bellagio.com/restaurants/olives.aspx">Todd English&#39;s Olives</a> for 2030.</p> <p>Olives was good - a bit weird but nice. V expensive - bottle of wine was around $100. We had this nice sweet potato flatbread, covered in ham, spring onions, gorgonzola and balsamic vinegar. Waiter a bit brash, --- it because we had to, but great view of the fountains.</p> <p>We hit the casino on the 1c slots, each with $1. I doubled my money! Then played a few hands of blackjack to get some chips to bring back. I played $10 a hand and started with $50 - I came out with $80! Score!</p> <p>Packed and hit the hay around 2300, early start tomorrow to fly to NYC.</p> </main> <footer> <h2>Site Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a></li> <li>&copy; Mark Crawley 2015</li> <li>Computer icon made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title=Freepik>Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title=Flaticon>www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></li> </ul> </footer> <script>(function(a,h,d,c,g,f){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c;a[c]||(a[c]=function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)});a[c].l=+new Date;g=h.createElement(d);f=h.getElementsByTagName(d)[0];g.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js";f.parentNode.insertBefore(g,f)}(window,document,"script","ga"));ga("create","UA-6098332-2");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
