Taxi to the airport was $16 this time! Check in was a nightmare, but now about to board our flight which is delayed by 30 minutes.</p> <p>The flight was fine, got in just after 1600. We got a $15 bus ride into Manhattan which took a while - about an hour. We got dropped off near <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/hilton-times-square-NYCTSHF/index.html">the hotel</a> and checked in no problem. Room 3115 looks down onto 42nd, it&#39;s not as plush as the Bellagio!</p> <p>We took a stroll around Times Square and found a BBQ restaurant called <a href="http://www.virgilsbbq.com/newyork/">Virgil&#39;s</a>, which was really cool. We ate ribs smoked in Hickory which were delicious but very filling! We went for a coffee at Starbucks across the road from the hotel then crashed.</p> </main> <footer> <h2>Site Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a></li> <li>&copy; Mark Crawley 2015</li> <li>Computer icon made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title=Freepik>Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title=Flaticon>www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></li> </ul> </footer> <script>(function(a,h,d,c,g,f){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c;a[c]||(a[c]=function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)});a[c].l=+new Date;g=h.createElement(d);f=h.getElementsByTagName(d)[0];g.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js";f.parentNode.insertBefore(g,f)}(window,document,"script","ga"));ga("create","UA-6098332-2");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
