The passed the largest Apple Store in the USA on Boylston and made a note to come back later for Rich&#39;s iPod Touch. We went into the Prudential Centre mall which was huge, and bought a few things. We went for lunch at the Cheesecake Factory and had pasta and cheesecake. We couldn&#39;t finish! - and got a doggy bag. We found a tea shop and got some stuff for Larry and Sue, then headed back to Apple. The store was great and we got an IBM discount on the iTouch and case.</p> <p>When we got back to the Radisson I went to take a photo or two upstairs looking over the Charles River, and to pick up a Boston Globe. We were still full from lunch, and Jo wasn&#39;t feeling too well! We went for ad rive down to Castle Island, then up to Harvard.</p> <p>When we got home we fancied a midnight (2200) feast so I drove over to Beacon Hill to pick up beer, hot chocolate, crisps and beef jerky. I managed to find a parking space and went to a 7-11 for the supplies. When it came to the hot chocolate I had to choose what cup to use: Obama, McCain or plan - this was used as polling data for the Presidential election!</p> <p>The feast was wikid! We stayed up watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit">Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (SVU)</a> which we&#39;d just discovered.</p> </main> <footer> <h2>Site Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a></li> <li>&copy; Mark Crawley 2015</li> <li>Computer icon made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title=Freepik>Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title=Flaticon>www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></li> </ul> </footer> <script>(function(a,h,d,c,g,f){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c;a[c]||(a[c]=function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)});a[c].l=+new Date;g=h.createElement(d);f=h.getElementsByTagName(d)[0];g.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js";f.parentNode.insertBefore(g,f)}(window,document,"script","ga"));ga("create","UA-6098332-2");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
