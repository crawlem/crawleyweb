We decided to go down to the Financial District today, and we left around lunch time. We went on the subway down to the World Trade Center. There wasn&#39;t much to see, but they&#39;re building something new on the old site. We strolled around Battery Park and sat for a while overlooking the Statue of Liberty. There were some great views of the skyscrapers and New Jersey.</p> <p>We decided to get the free Staten Island Ferry which sails past the Statue of Liberty for a closer look. By this time it was 1730 so the ferry out to Staten Island was packed. We didn&#39;t take any photos on the way out, and at the other end we walked straight round to get back on the ferry to Manhattan - this time it was empty! We got some photos but suspect they won&#39;t be that good as the light was fading and boat moving!</p> <p>We got the subway back to Times Square and wandered back towards the hotel on 41st. We didn&#39;t want fries, grease or burgers so went into Bar 41 for a few drinks and a light dinner. It was nice to drink Bud/wine &#39;til late.</p> </main> <footer> <h2>Site Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a></li> <li>&copy; Mark Crawley 2015</li> <li>Computer icon made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title=Freepik>Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title=Flaticon>www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></li> </ul> </footer> <script>(function(a,h,d,c,g,f){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c;a[c]||(a[c]=function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)});a[c].l=+new Date;g=h.createElement(d);f=h.getElementsByTagName(d)[0];g.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js";f.parentNode.insertBefore(g,f)}(window,document,"script","ga"));ga("create","UA-6098332-2");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
