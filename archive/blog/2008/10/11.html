We actually made it for the 0515 coach, and got to Terminal 3 before we should have even left the hotel!</p> <p>We checked in without incident and wandered around for a bit before getting breakfast at O&#39;Neils. Today was all about traveling; over twelve hours of flying ahead with American Airlines.</p> <p>Heathrow to Chicago was on a 777 and we had our own pair of seats near the back. Three movies, two lots of food and eight hours later we landed in Chicago, feeling pretty rinsed already! Losing six hours will do that! We had to pick up our baggage and drop it off for our onward connection to Vegas. We had a couple of hours to kill so mooched and got a McDs.</p> <p>Chicago to Las Vegas was AA Boeing 757, so we had more cramped conditions and someone else sat with us (a friendly American dude). Four hours, no personal TVs and another two hours lost in the timezone. We were very ready to get off the plane, and really wanted a nap as it was 0200 UK time, but only 1500 local!</p> <p>Taxi to <a href="http://www.bellagio.com/">Bellagio</a> stiffed us for $28, but wow! Our hotel is absolutely gorgeous, massive and expensive. <a href="http://www.bellagio.com/hotel/fountain-view.aspx">Our room (24608)</a> is lovely too. By the time we&#39;d bathed/showered there wasn&#39;t time for a nap before we picked up the tickets for <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/o/default.aspx">&quot;O&quot;</a> and got a bite to eat - probably a good thing! We walked through the casino to the &quot;O&quot; ticket desk - it is awesome! Our tickets were ready for us, then we want to Caf√© P--- for a sandwich, a cookie and plenty of water to rehydrate after the flying. $25 for that!</p> <p>&quot;O&quot; was absolutely incredible. We were in seats B8 and B9, right at the front. We got splashed a couple of times, nothing serious. Best seats I think, right up close to the performers. Acrobatics were amazing, especially high diving. When it ended my eyes were starting to droop so off to bed straight away! I just hope we sleep OK and jet lag doesn&#39;t kick in too badly.</p> </main> <footer> <h2>Site Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a></li> <li>&copy; Mark Crawley 2015</li> <li>Computer icon made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title=Freepik>Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title=Flaticon>www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></li> </ul> </footer> <script>(function(a,h,d,c,g,f){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c;a[c]||(a[c]=function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)});a[c].l=+new Date;g=h.createElement(d);f=h.getElementsByTagName(d)[0];g.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js";f.parentNode.insertBefore(g,f)}(window,document,"script","ga"));ga("create","UA-6098332-2");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
