I went out for &quot;breakfast&quot; (lasagne) from the same place as on debate night - <a href="http://www.abitinospizza.com/">Abitinos</a> on 7th and 41st. We watched a show about cake creation in the shape of famous skylines! Today we decided to split up, and Jo went shopping while I went to take some photos and locate Hertz for tomorrow.</p> <p>I walked South down 7th to 34th, where Macy&#39;s is. I found Hertz on 34th between 8th and 9th, then walked back along 34th to Broadway. Turning South I walked down Broadway all the way to the Flatiron Building. I thought from 29th onwards it got a little seedy, but the Flatiron Building was worth it, beautiful. I got back to the hotel just before Jo at 1720. Tonight we&#39;re going up the Empire State Building to celebrate our last night in NYC.</p> <p>It took about two hours to get to the 86th floor observation deck, but it was worth it. Amazing views of NYC including Chrysler Building and Times Square. It was freezing up there though, so we walked around one lap then queued up to come down again.</p> <p>We had a late dinner in Bar 41 then hit the hay ready for tomorrow.</p> </main> <footer> <h2>Site Information</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a></li> <li>&copy; Mark Crawley 2015</li> <li>Computer icon made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title=Freepik>Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title=Flaticon>www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></li> </ul> </footer> <script>(function(a,h,d,c,g,f){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c;a[c]||(a[c]=function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)});a[c].l=+new Date;g=h.createElement(d);f=h.getElementsByTagName(d)[0];g.src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js";f.parentNode.insertBefore(g,f)}(window,document,"script","ga"));ga("create","UA-6098332-2");ga("send","pageview");</script> </body> </html>
