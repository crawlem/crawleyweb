strapline: IT architect and techie
---
I'm an experienced Enterprise and Solution Architect, working on digital transformation projects on the south coast of England.

Software engineering is now a hobby rather than a job, but still something I enjoy doing and teaching my kids.

Home is Southsea (Portsmouth), with my partner and two daughters.
