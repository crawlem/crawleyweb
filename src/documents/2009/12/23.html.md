The UK is always paralysed after a bit if snow. You'd think we would learn, seeing as there normally is at least one snowfall each year. But no, roads aren't thoroughly gritted and drivers end up abandoning their cars across the country. Fortunately near us it hasn't been too bad, and only minor disruption to travel. Getting the train up to London yesterday showed off some of the worst hit places, like Basingstoke where 2000 motorists had to abandon their cars a couple of nights ago. Despite that, it sure is beautiful.
