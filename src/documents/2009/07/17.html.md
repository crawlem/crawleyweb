A few days ago our cat, Wagamama, got run over and died. It was a very sad Sunday morning, and not the sort of phone call you want to receive at 7.30am. The house seemed really empty without a pet so we found a new kitten, Max, to come and live with us.

He is super cute, mainly while asleep as when he's awake he can't get enough play time. But it's very nice to have a little friend running about the place again.
