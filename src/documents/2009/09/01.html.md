I've realised that I'm a man of routine, at least in some areas of life. I think this is partly a coping mechanism to counteract my bad memory. For example, I'm useless at remembering where I put things. So I have a set pocket, place at home and place at the office for my wallet, keys and phone. I have a place in the car for my glasses, which I reach for even if I'm already *wearing* my glasses. If these things are not in their places I'm lost.

However, I'm not good with daily routine. I don't sleep well and first thing in the morning is not my best time. I like not having to get up at the same time each day, and varying my sleep routine slightly to match my schedule.

I'm a fan of [Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), and use this to dump tasks that I need to remember to do later. I use the RTM iPhone app to nag me when tasks are due and display tasks that are relevant to my current location. I also subscribe to the "[Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/)" principle, and am pretty good at clearing down my various inboxes.

I have a habit of checking email too often, re-reading things I've already sent and taking "keeping on top of" my RSS feeds to the extreme. I'm determined to change these routines to increase my productivity. I want to expand the time I have in my working day without expanding my working hours, and these routines need to die.
